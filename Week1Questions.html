      <section class="answer">
        <p>Is this a good question? I think it is okay even though it
          is mostly involved with memorizing syntax. Why? This syntax is
          fundamental, i.e., a student would use it frequently. The question
          also gives a hint to the answer.

      <section class="question">
        <p>How are <em>heading</em> elements similar and different from
          the <em>header</em> element?
      </section>
      <section class="answer">
        <p>Heading elements h1-h6 give an indication of what the following
        content is about and hence "introduce" that content. The header
        element is similar in this regard, however the header element is a
        container and can contain multiple elements. In addition it is good
        and commont practice to include a heading element within a header
        element.  </p>
